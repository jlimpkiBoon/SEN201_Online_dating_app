Function purposed


* create_user(username, age, city, hobby) : inserts a user with a unique username.
* get_user(username) : fetches one row (SQLite Row)
* update_user(username, age, city, hobby) : updates fields by username
* delete_user(username) : delete account by username


Problem and issues found 


1. Type ambiguity from CLI : The function in user_repo didn’t check the attribute of the user input 
2. No ensuring message such as return values: create_user function doesn't return anything like a user is successfully created.
3. Input validation: the function accepts input without validation from the user into the database.
